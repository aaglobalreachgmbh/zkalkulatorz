# 🧪 UX Audit Harness Plan (Phase 12)

**Status:** Active
**Method:** Antigravity Browser Agent (Automated Screenshots)
**Fallback:** Manual Human Walkthrough

---

## Strategy
Since Playwright is not fully integrated in CI yet, we will use the **Antigravity Browser Subagent** to act as the audit harness.

**Advantages:**
*   Can execute complex flows (Login -> Wizard -> Toggle Mode).
*   Can capture real `viewport` screenshots (1366x768 etc.).
*   Automatically saves evidence to artifacts.

## Target Viewports

| Name | Resolution | Context |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Laptop Standard** | 1366 x 768 | **Primary Target (Zero-Scroll)** |
| **Desktop HD** | 1920 x 1080 | Enterprise Wide |
| **Tablet Portrait** | 768 x 1024 | Field Sales (iPad) |
| **Mobile** | 375 x 667 | Quick Check (iPhone SE) |

## Acceptance Gates (The "Zero-Scroll" Certification)

For **Laptop Standard (1366x768)**, the following MUST be visible simultaneously:
1.  **Tariff Input** (at least 3 rows)
2.  **Live Summary Panel** (Total & Margin)
3.  **"Add to Offer" Button** (Primary CTA)
4.  **Header Navigation**

If the user has to scroll to find the "Add" button while selecting a tariff, the test **FAILS**.

## Execution Protocol

1.  **Before (Checkpoint 12.2):** Run Browser Agent to capture current state.
2.  **After (Checkpoint 12.3):** Run Browser Agent to verify fix.
3.  **Review (Checkpoint 12.5):** User verifies the Evidence Pack.
