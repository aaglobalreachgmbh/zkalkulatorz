## Available Models
* **Antigravity (Gemini 3 Pro based):** Primary Agent (Design, Logic, Implementation)
* **Claude:** **Unavailable** (Explicitly checked runtime availability)

## Tooling Strategy
Since Claude is unavailable for second-opinion critiques, Antigravity will assume `Self-Critique Mode` during the **12.2 ANALYZE** and **12.5 REVIEW** checkpoints.

**Self-Critique Protocol:**
1. Generate implementation
2. Switch context to "Adversarial QA"
3. Audit own code for deviations from "Wolkenkratzer Standard"
4. Fix findings before user delivery
